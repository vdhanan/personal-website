I am a recent graduate of Claremont McKenna College, where I majored in Computer Science (through neighboring Pomona College).

I am curious, competitive, and hard-working.

I like to play chess, poker, and basketball. Feel free to add [me] (https://www.chess.com/member/dhaniv) on chess.com if you play.

I also like to read... everything from graphic novels to personal essays.

I write some of my musings about tech, film, and other miscellaneous topics on my [blog] (http://localhost:1313/posts).

Here's my [résumé] (http://localhost:1313/varun_resume.pdf).
